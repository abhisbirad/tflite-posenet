tflite posenet implementation in C++ (Android version)

There was no C++ inference implementation for posenet as of today (23/08/2020),  I had to manually create a c++ version of code referring to the android application 
share with tflite sample (https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android)...

Please note android version of code (As per tflite sample application) only supports one person pose detection in an image..

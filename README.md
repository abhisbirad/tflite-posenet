tflite posenet implementation in C++ (Android version)

There was no C++ inference implementation for posenet as of today (23/08/2020),  I had to manually create a c++ version of code referring to the android application 
share with tflite sample (https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview).  Please note android version of code only supports one person pose detection in an image..
